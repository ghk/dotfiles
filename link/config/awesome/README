Fetch that by using the command ''git clone http://github.com/dmj/misc.git''. You'll have to move into a couple of directories and then copy the 2 files called mail-simple.lua and imap.lua to your ~/.config/awesome/

Make sure to set your username and password as directed in mail-simple.lua:

  imap_user = "myimaploginname@myhost.com"
  imap_padd = "88693jkjfdkf"

Also change the host name and other relevant details a few lines above- they don't need to be changed for gmail users though as it's set to gmail by default.

In rc.lua, at the top, I added under require("debian.menu") a new line:

  require("debian.menu")
  require("mail-simple") -- new line

Scroll down a bit to:


        -- mylayoutbox[s],
        mytextclock,
        s == 1 and mysystray or nil,
        w_imap,  -- ADD THIS NEW LINE HERE
        mytasklist[s],
        layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.rightleft

If you log out it should now work.
